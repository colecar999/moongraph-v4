# API Refactoring Plan: Breaking Down the Monolithic api.py

## Overview

The current `morphik-core/core/api.py` file was 2,303 lines long and contained all API endpoints in a single monolithic file. This refactoring plan outlines a phased approach to break it down into modular, maintainable routers organized by functional domain.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Structure
- **Main file**: `morphik-core/core/api.py` (~~2,303~~ **1,843 lines** - reduced by ~460 lines)
- **New router structure**: `morphik-core/core/api_routers/` (created during Phase 1)
- **Enterprise pattern**: `ee/routers/` shows the target pattern with proper router organization
- **Frontend proxy pattern**: Frontend routes in `frontend/src/app/api/` proxy to backend

### Route Categories Identified
1. **‚úÖ Documents** (11 endpoints) - **COMPLETED in Phase 1**
2. **Folders** (7 endpoints)
3. **Graphs** (6 endpoints) 
4. **Ingest** (3 endpoints)
5. **Retrieval** (4 endpoints)
6. **Query/Agent** (2 endpoints)
7. **Cache** (6 endpoints)
8. **Usage/Telemetry** (2 endpoints)
9. **Health/Auth** (3 endpoints)
10. **Unified** (2 endpoints)
11. **Local Development** (1 endpoint)

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Documents Router (COMPLETED)

### Implementation Summary
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Successfully deployed and tested
**Date Completed**: May 26, 2025
**Lines Reduced**: ~460 lines moved from main api.py

### What Was Accomplished

#### ‚úÖ File Structure Created
```
morphik-core/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api.py (1,843 lines, down from 2,303)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api_routers/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ documents.py (458 lines)
```

#### ‚úÖ Endpoints Successfully Moved (11 total)
All document-related endpoints were successfully moved to `core/api_routers/documents.py`:

1. ‚úÖ `GET /documents` - List documents
2. ‚úÖ `GET /documents/{document_id}` - Get document by ID
3. ‚úÖ `GET /documents/{document_id}/status` - Get document status
4. ‚úÖ `GET /documents/filename/{filename}` - Get document by filename
5. ‚úÖ `DELETE /documents/{document_id}` - Delete document
6. ‚úÖ `POST /documents/{document_id}/update_text` - Update document text
7. ‚úÖ `POST /documents/{document_id}/update_file` - Update document file
8. ‚úÖ `POST /documents/{document_id}/update_metadata` - Update document metadata
9. ‚úÖ `POST /batch/documents` - Batch get documents
10. ‚úÖ `POST /batch/chunks` - Batch get chunks
11. ‚úÖ `POST /retrieve/docs` - Retrieve documents (semantic search)

#### ‚úÖ Router Integration
- Router successfully included in main `api.py` with proper error handling
- All imports and dependencies correctly moved
- Telemetry tracking preserved for all endpoints
- RBAC and authentication flows maintained

#### ‚úÖ Testing Results
**Manual Testing Completed**: All endpoints tested and verified working
- ‚úÖ Backend startup successful with documents router
- ‚úÖ All 11 document endpoints respond correctly via curl
- ‚úÖ Frontend integration works without changes
- ‚úÖ Telemetry data captured correctly in logs
- ‚úÖ Authentication and authorization working
- ‚úÖ No functionality regressions detected

### Implementation Details

#### Router Structure
```python
# morphik-core/core/api_routers/documents.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
router = APIRouter(tags=["Documents"])

# All document endpoints with preserved functionality
# - Telemetry tracking maintained
# - RBAC checks preserved  
# - Error handling unchanged
# - Import dependencies correctly resolved
```

#### Main API Integration
```python
# morphik-core/core/api.py
try:
    from core.api_routers.documents import router as documents_router
    app.include_router(documents_router)
    logger.info("Documents router included successfully")
except ImportError as exc:
    logger.error("Failed to import documents router: %s", exc, exc_info=True)
```

### Lessons Learned

#### ‚úÖ What Worked Well
1. **Automated Endpoint Removal**: Python script successfully removed ~20KB of code
2. **Router Pattern**: FastAPI router inclusion worked seamlessly
3. **Dependency Management**: All imports and services properly shared
4. **Zero Frontend Impact**: Proxy pattern completely shielded frontend
5. **Telemetry Preservation**: All tracking decorators moved successfully
6. **RBAC Maintenance**: Authentication and authorization flows unchanged

#### üîß Challenges Encountered
1. **Import Path Confusion**: Initially tried `core/api/` but needed `core/api_routers/`
2. **Router Prefix Issues**: Had to remove prefix to avoid double-prefixing paths
3. **Bulk Code Removal**: Manual removal would have been error-prone, script was essential

#### üìù Best Practices Established
1. **Backup First**: Always backup original file before major changes
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test router inclusion before bulk endpoint removal
3. **Automated Removal**: Use scripts for bulk code removal to avoid errors
4. **Log Monitoring**: Watch backend logs during deployment for issues
5. **Manual Verification**: Thoroughly test all moved endpoints individually

## Future Phases (Remaining Work)

### Phase 2: Folders Router (Next Priority)
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

## Rollback Strategy

### Phase 1 Rollback (if needed)
1. **Immediate Rollback**: Comment out router inclusion in main `api.py`
2. **Full Rollback**: Restore original `api.py` from backup (`core/api.py.backup`)
3. **Partial Rollback**: Move specific problematic endpoints back to main file

### Monitoring During Future Phases
- Watch backend logs for any errors after deployment
- Monitor frontend functionality manually
- Check for any authentication/authorization issues
- Verify telemetry data is being logged correctly

## Updated Implementation Timeline

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Documents Router
**Status**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Duration**: 1 day
**Outcome**: Successful deployment, all tests passing

### üîÑ Next Phase: Folders Router
**Estimated Start**: Ready to begin
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 days
**Priority**: High (includes newly created `/folders/stats` endpoint)

### Remaining Phases
**Total Estimated Time**: 20-25 days for complete refactoring
**Approach**: Continue incremental, independent deployments
**Risk Level**: Low (Phase 1 proved the approach works)

## Conclusion

Phase 1 of the API refactoring has been successfully completed, demonstrating that the modular router approach works effectively. The documents router is now fully operational with:

- ‚úÖ 460 lines of code moved to dedicated router
- ‚úÖ All 11 document endpoints working correctly  
- ‚úÖ Zero impact on frontend functionality
- ‚úÖ Preserved telemetry and RBAC functionality
