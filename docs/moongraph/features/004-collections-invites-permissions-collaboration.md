# Collections, Invites, Permissions & Collaboration

**Date:** 2025-01-27 (Updated)  
**Author:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** âœ… **FOUNDATION COMPLETED** - Ready for Phase 2 Implementation  
**Priority:** High (Beta Launch)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for collections-based collaboration features for the Moongraph beta launch. The goal is to enable simple, secure sharing of research collections while maintaining a clean user experience and fast development timeline.

**UPDATE:** The foundation has been successfully implemented with collections model, privacy levels, RBAC integration, and modular API architecture. The system is now ready for email invitations and public sharing features.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Simplicity First
- âœ… Collection-level permissions implemented (no granular document/graph permissions in UI)
- âœ… Three privacy levels: Private, Shared, Public
- âœ… Full read/write access for all collaborators (RBAC foundation ready)
- âœ… Business logic implementation (leveraging existing RBAC database schema)

### 2.2 Security & Trust
- âœ… No accidental public exposure of private content (database constraints implemented)
- âœ… Clear permission inheritance rules (folder-based RBAC)
- âœ… Explicit consent for sharing (privacy level validation)
- âœ… Graph visibility = most restrictive document visibility (cross-validation implemented)

### 2.3 Growth-Oriented
- ðŸ”„ Email-based invitations for viral growth (database schema ready)
- ðŸ”„ Public graph sharing for discovery (infrastructure prepared)
- ðŸ”„ Attribution and credit system (foundation ready)
- âœ… Future-ready for public discovery features (modular architecture)

## 3. Terminology & Concepts

### 3.1 Collections (formerly Folders) âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Collection**: âœ… Curated group of documents and graphs with shared permissions
- **Owner**: âœ… User who created the collection, has full admin rights (FolderAdmin role)
- **Collaborator**: ðŸ”„ User invited to collection, has read/write access to all contents (ready for implementation)
- **Privacy Level**: âœ… Determines who can discover and access the collection

### 3.2 Privacy Levels âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**

| Level | Discovery | Access | Use Case | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Private** | Owner only | Owner only | Personal research, drafts | âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Shared** | Not discoverable | Owner + invited collaborators | Team projects, private collaboration | âœ… **FOUNDATION READY** |
| **Public** | Discoverable by anyone | Owner + invited collaborators | Open research, public projects | âœ… **FOUNDATION READY** |

### 3.3 Permission Inheritance âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Documents**: âœ… Inherit collection privacy level and permissions
- **Graphs**: âœ… Inherit most restrictive document privacy level with cross-validation
- **Cross-collection graphs**: âœ… Blocked if any document is more restrictive

## 4. User Stories

### 4.1 Collection Management âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
```
As a researcher, I want to:
- âœ… Create collections with clear privacy levels
- âœ… Organize my documents and graphs by research topic
- âœ… Change privacy levels as my research progresses
- âœ… See at a glance who has access to my collections
```

### 4.2 Collaboration ðŸ”„ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
```
As a collection owner, I want to:
- ðŸ”„ Invite collaborators via email (only owners can invite)
- ðŸ”„ Give collaborators full read/write access to collection contents
- ðŸ”„ Remove collaborators when needed
- ðŸ”„ See who has access to my collections

As a collaborator, I want to:
- ðŸ”„ Receive clear email invitations
- ðŸ”„ Understand what access I'm being granted
- ðŸ”„ Contribute documents and graphs to shared collections
- ðŸ”„ Leave collections I no longer need access to
- ðŸ”„ Know that my contributions remain if I'm removed
```

### 4.3 Public Sharing ðŸ”„ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
```
As a researcher, I want to:
- ðŸ”„ Share my graphs publicly for broader impact
- âœ… Ensure I don't accidentally expose private collaborator data (validation implemented)
- ðŸ”„ Enable anonymous users to interact with my public graphs
- ðŸ”„ Control when to make graphs public or private

As a visitor, I want to:
- ðŸ”„ Discover and interact with public graphs without signing up
- ðŸ”„ Understand the research context
- ðŸ”„ Zoom, filter, and explore graph data
- ðŸ”„ Access graphs via direct links
```
