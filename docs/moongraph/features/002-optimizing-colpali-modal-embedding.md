# Feature: Optimizing Colpali Modal Embedding Service for Speed and Best Practices

## Overview
This document describes strategies and best practices for optimizing the Colpali Modal embedding service for speed, reliability, and maintainability. It covers GPU utilization, attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention2), processor speed, environment variables, model loading, and Modal class parameterization.

## 1. Use Fast Attention Implementations (FlashAttention2)

**FlashAttention2** can significantly accelerate transformer inference on supported GPUs. To enable it:

- Ensure your model loading code sets `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` when running on CUDA.
- Install the `flash-attn` package in your Modal image:

```python
# In your Modal image definition
modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(
    "torch",
    "transformers",
    "colpali-engine>=0.1.0",
    "Pillow",
    "numpy",
    "filetype",
    "fastapi",
    "uvicorn",
    "flash-attn"  # Add this line
)
```

- If installation fails, check CUDA compatibility and refer to [HuggingFace FlashAttention2 docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_infer_gpu_one#flashattention-2).
- If you cannot use FlashAttention2, fallback to `attn_implementation="eager"` (slower but more compatible).

---

## 2. Use Fast Image/Text Processors

- The logs may warn: `Using a slow image processor as use_fast is unset...`
- To use the fast processor, set `use_fast=True` when loading the processor:

```python
self.processor = ColQwen2_5_Processor.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    token=hf_token,
    cache_dir="/cache/huggingface/hub",
    use_fast=True  # Add this argument
)
```
- Fast processors can provide significant speedups for tokenization and preprocessing.

---

## 3. Environment Variables and Caching

- Use `HF_HOME` instead of `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` to avoid deprecation warnings:

```python
gpu_image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(...).env({
    "HF_HOME": "/cache/huggingface",
    "HF_HUB_CACHE": "/cache/huggingface/hub",
    "PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR": "true",
})
```
- This ensures model and processor files are cached efficiently and avoids future compatibility issues.

---

## 4. Modal Class Parameterization (Future-Proofing)

- Modal will deprecate custom `__init__` constructors for class-based apps. Use `modal.parameter()` for class fields:

```python
class ColpaliModalService:
    model_name: str = modal.parameter()
    # ...
```
- See [Modal parameterized functions docs](https://modal.com/docs/guide/parametrized-functions) for details.

---

## 5. Model Loading and Cold Start Optimization

- Model loading can take 30â€“60 seconds on cold start. To reduce user-facing latency:
    - Use Modal's `scaledown_window` to keep containers warm longer.
    - Preload models and processors in the class constructor or `__enter__`.
    - Monitor logs for loading times and optimize image size and dependencies.

---

## 6. General Best Practices

- Always check logs for deprecation warnings and errors.
- Use GPU instances for heavy models (e.g., T4, A10G).
- Batch requests where possible to maximize throughput.
- Profile and monitor execution times (see `duration` and `execution` in logs).
- Keep dependencies up to date and pin versions for reproducibility.
