# Authentication & RBAC System Implementation

## Overview

**Implementation Date:** January 2025 (Updated with API Refactoring & Collections)  
**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY & ENHANCED**  
**Testing Status:** ✅ **CORE RBAC LOGIC VERIFIED** (API router integration tested)

Moongraph now has a complete, production-ready authentication and significantly enhanced Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system integrating Auth0, NextAuth.js, JWT verification, user provisioning, granular resource permissions, modular API architecture, and collections-based collaboration features.

## Recent Enhancements (January 2025)

### ✅ API Refactoring Integration
- **Modular Router Architecture**: RBAC seamlessly integrated across 3 new API routers
- **Documents Router**: 11 endpoints with full RBAC preservation and folder inheritance
- **Folders Router**: 8 endpoints with enhanced collections management and privacy levels
- **Graphs Router**: 6 endpoints with folder-based access control and content filtering
- **Consistent Authorization**: Unified RBAC patterns across all router endpoints

### ✅ Collections Model Implementation
- **Terminology Evolution**: Folders → Collections in UI while preserving database schema
- **Privacy Levels**: Private, Shared, Public visibility levels with database enforcement
- **Enhanced Ownership**: User and team ownership models with constraint validation
- **Collaboration Foundation**: Database schema ready for invitation-based sharing

### ✅ Enhanced Permission Resolution
- **Folder-Centric Access**: Documents and graphs inherit permissions from containing folders
- **Unfiled Content Management**: Direct ownership model for content not in collections
- **Cross-Resource Validation**: Graph sharing validates all contained document permissions
- **Real-time Authorization**: Permission checks at database layer for all operations

## Core Components

### 1. Authentication Flow (Enhanced)
- **Auth0**: Identity Provider with Universal Login
- **NextAuth.js**: Client-side session management in the frontend
- **JWT Verification**: Backend (FastAPI) verifies RS256 signed JWTs against Auth0's JWKS
- **User Provisioning**: Automatic user creation in the local database upon their first verified API call
- **API Router Integration**: Authentication context passed seamlessly to all router endpoints

### 2. Authorization System (RBAC) - Enhanced

#### Core RBAC Features
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permissions system based on Users, Permissions, and Roles
- **Resource-Specific Permissions**: Folder-level access control with inheritance to contained content
- **Collections Model**: Enhanced folder system with privacy levels and collaboration features
- **Ownership-Based Access**: Unfiled Documents and Graphs accessible by their direct owner
- **Dynamic Permission Resolution**: Real-time access checks at database and API layers

#### Collections Privacy Levels
- **Private**: Only owner can access (default for new collections)
- **Shared**: Owner + invited collaborators can access (invitation system ready)
- **Public**: Discoverable by anyone, owner + collaborators can edit

#### Permission Inheritance Model
- **Documents in Collections**: Inherit collection permissions (folder:read → document access)
- **Graphs in Collections**: Inherit collection permissions + validate all contained documents
- **Unfiled Content**: Direct ownership via `owner` field in document/graph metadata
- **Cross-Collection Graphs**: Blocked if any contained document is more restrictive

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Authentication Stack

**Frontend (Next.js) - Unchanged:**
```javascript
// NextAuth.js configuration with Auth0 provider
// File: frontend/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.js
Auth0Provider({
  clientId: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
  issuer: process.env.AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL,
  authorization: {
    params: {
      audience: process.env.AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER,
    },
  },
})
```

**Backend (FastAPI) - Enhanced with Router Integration:**
```python
# JWT verification using PyJWT and JWKS (unchanged)
async def verify_auth0_jwt(token: str, auth0_domain: str, api_identifier: str) -> dict:
    # Fetches JWKS (cached)
    # Selects correct public key based on token's 'kid'
    # Decodes and verifies token signature, 'iss', 'aud', 'exp' claims
    # Returns decoded payload

# User Provisioning and AuthContext creation (enhanced)
async def verify_token(authorization: str = Header(None)) -> AuthContext:
    # ... (token extraction and JWT verification)
    # Calls _get_or_create_db_user(auth0_user_id, payload, database)
    # Constructs AuthContext with internal user_id, entity_id, and permissions
    # AuthContext now used across all API routers
```

### API Router Architecture

**Router Structure Pattern:**
```python
# Standard router structure (e.g., core/api_routers/documents.py)
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from core.auth_utils import verify_token
from core.services.telemetry import TelemetryService

router = APIRouter(tags=["Documents"])
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
telemetry = TelemetryService()

@router.get("/documents/{document_id}")
@telemetry.track(operation_type="get_document", metadata_resolver=telemetry.get_document_metadata)
async def get_document(document_id: str, auth: AuthContext = Depends(verify_token)):
    # RBAC check handled by document_service.db.get_document(document_id, auth)
    # Returns document if user has folder:read on containing folder OR owns unfiled document
```

**Main API Integration:**
```python
# In main api.py
try:
    from core.api_routers.documents import router as documents_router
    from core.api_routers.folders import router as folders_router
    from core.api_routers.graphs import router as graphs_router
    
    app.include_router(documents_router)
    app.include_router(folders_router)
    app.include_router(graphs_router)
    
    logger.info("All API routers included successfully")
except ImportError as exc:
    logger.error("Failed to import API routers: %s", exc, exc_info=True)
```

### Enhanced RBAC Database Schema

**Core Tables (Enhanced):**
- `users` (`UserModel`): Stores user profiles, linking Auth0 `sub` to internal `user_id` (UUID)
- `teams` (`TeamModel`): Defines teams and their owners (foundation ready)
- `team_memberships` (`TeamMembershipModel`): Junction table for users and teams with roles
- `permissions` (`PermissionModel`): Atomic permission strings (`folder:read`, `folder:write`, `folder:admin`)
- `roles` (`RoleModel`): Groups permissions with scope (`FolderViewer`, `FolderEditor`, `FolderAdmin`)
- `role_permissions` (`RolePermissionModel`): Maps permissions to roles
- `user_folder_roles` (`UserFolderRoleModel`): Assigns users specific roles for folders
- `team_folder_roles` (`TeamFolderRoleModel`): Assigns teams specific roles for folders
- `folders` (`FolderModel`): Collections with enhanced ownership and privacy levels
- `documents` (`DocumentModel`): Document metadata with `folder_id` foreign key
- `graphs` (`GraphModel`): Graph metadata with `folder_id` foreign key

**Enhanced Permission Resolution Logic:**

#### For Collections (`_check_folder_access_rbac`):
1. Takes a `Folder` object, `AuthContext`, and `required_permission` (e.g., "folder:write")
2. Queries `get_user_permissions_for_folder` which:
   - Finds direct roles for `auth.user_id` on `folder.id` via `UserFolderRoleModel`
   - Finds roles for teams the user is part of on `folder.id` via `TeamMembershipModel` and `TeamFolderRoleModel`
   - Collects all unique permissions from these roles via `RolePermissionModel`
3. Checks if `required_permission` is in the collected set
4. **Used by all API routers** for consistent permission enforcement

#### For Documents (Enhanced in Documents Router):
1. Fetches the document via `document_service.db.get_document(document_id, auth)`
2. Checks `system_metadata` for `folder_id` (preferred) or `folder_name`
3. **If associated with a collection:**
   - Calls `db.get_folder(folder_id, auth)` which internally uses `_check_folder_access_rbac` for "folder:read"
   - If successful, grants read access to the document
   - For write/delete operations, explicitly checks "folder:write" on containing folder
4. **If not associated with a collection (unfiled):**
   - Checks if `auth.user_id` matches the `owner` field of the document
   - Owners have implicit full access to their unfiled items

#### For Graphs (Enhanced in Graphs Router):
1. Fetches the graph via `document_service.db.get_graph(name, auth, system_filters)`
2. Checks `system_metadata` for `folder_id` (preferred) or `folder_name`
3. **If associated with a collection:**
   - Calls `db.get_folder(folder_id, auth)` for "folder:read" permission
   - Filters `document_ids` within the graph based on user's document permissions
   - For write/update operations, checks "folder:write" on containing folder
4. **If not associated with a collection (unfiled):**
   - Checks if `auth.user_id` matches the `owner` field of the graph
   - Filters `document_ids` based on user's access to individual documents

### Collections Model Implementation

**Collection Creation with Privacy Levels:**
```python
# Frontend collection creation (unified page)
const handleCreateCollection = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/folders', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      name: collectionForm.name,
      description: collectionForm.description,
      visibility: collectionForm.privacy, // 'private', 'shared', 'public'
    }),
  })
}

# Backend collection creation (folders router)
@router.post("/folders")
async def create_folder(folder_data: FolderCreate, auth: AuthContext = Depends(verify_token)):
    # Creates folder with specified visibility
    # Automatically assigns creator as FolderAdmin
    # Validates privacy level and ownership
```

**Privacy Level Enforcement:**
```python
# Database-level privacy validation
class FolderModel(Base):
    visibility = Column(String(20), nullable=False, server_default="private")
    
    __table_args__ = (
        CheckConstraint(
            "visibility IN ('private', 'shared', 'public')", 
            name="chk_folder_visibility"
        ),
    )

# API-level privacy enforcement
async def get_folders(self, auth: AuthContext, include_public: bool = False) -> List[FolderModel]:
    # Returns folders user has access to based on:
    # - Direct ownership
    # - Shared via user_folder_roles
    # - Shared via team_folder_roles
    # - Public folders (if include_public=True)
```

### User Provisioning Flow (Enhanced)

```python
async def _get_or_create_db_user(auth0_user_id: str, auth0_payload: dict, db: PostgresDatabase) -> dict:
    # 1. db.fetch_user_by_auth0_id(auth0_user_id)
    # 2. If not found:
    #    Extract email, name, avatar_url from auth0_payload
    #    db.create_user_from_auth0_data(...)
    # 3. Returns dictionary with:
    #    - internal 'id' (as internal_user_id)
    #    - 'auth0_user_id', 'email'
    #    - 'entity_type' (USER), 'entity_id' (internal_user_id)
    #    - 'app_id' (from token)
    #    - 'permissions' (empty set for global permissions)
    # 4. Enhanced: Supports team membership resolution for future features
```
