# Legacy Reference Files: *.og.* Naming Convention

Any file with `*.og.*` in its name (for example, `component.og.tsx`) is considered a legacy or reference file. These files are not in active use by the application and are retained in the project for reference only.

**Guidelines:**
- Do not modify, refactor, or delete these files unless explicitly instructed by the user.
- If you are unsure whether a file is legacy or in active use, flag the issue to the user for clarification.
- The `.og.` naming convention is a signal that the file is for reference and not part of the current application logic.

This rule applies to all files in the codebase matching the `*.og.*` pattern.
